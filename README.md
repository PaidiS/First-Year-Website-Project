# First-Year-Website-Project
A charity website based on ocean preservation

four our module "Representation and Modelling" we were put into groups of 4 and tasked with creating a website charity website. We decided to create a charity about ocean preservation and split the work evenly by each creating one page of the website. I was put in charge of creating the home page. My contribution to the project is contained in the "index.html" file and the "index.css" files. This project was designed so that we could showcase the html and css we had learned over the two weeks we had covered it and so i tried to utilise as many techniques as I could.

To give the page a colourful and aesthetic appearance I gave the page a background image that was related to the charitys cause. I also created a header on the top of the page which would direct the user to the other 3 pages. Similary at the bottom of the page I created icons with suggestions on how the user could help the charitys cause. When clicked on these icons would also redirect the user to the appropriate page. I also linked a youtube video about the issues the ocean currently faces as that is a feature seen in many professional websites.
